## First Usage

Firstly, install [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) - this is used by the music21 library to generate score images.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If the app does not work, you may need to run the following command to help music21 find the MuseScore installation:

`python -m music21.configure`
